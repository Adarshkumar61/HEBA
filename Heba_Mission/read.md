HEBA stands for:

H – Health
E – Elderly
B – Bachelors
A – Assistant

Mission Statement:

HEBA’s mission is to create an affordable, intelligent, and autonomous assistant robot that helps humans manage daily life efficiently — especially in healthcare support, elderly care, and bachelors’ lifestyle management.

HEBA is built to reduce physical and mental load by handling routine tasks such as cleaning, object handling, reminders, and scheduled activities, while remaining simple to control and easy to teach.

This project aims to bridge the gap between real-world problems and practical robotics, focusing on usability, affordability, and real deployment — not just theory.


HEBA represents a step toward practical personal robotics — helping people live better, safer, and more organized lives.

It is built by learning, experimenting, and solving real problems — not by copying existing solutions.
